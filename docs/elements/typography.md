## Heading

Often, the visual design is at odds with the structural hierarchy of a page, so Alexander includes a set of heading classes. They can be applied to any heading to make it look like any other heading level. This is useful for areas of a page where the heading level may structurally be an h2, such as in a footer, but look best with smaller font sizes.

<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6>

<h2 class="heading-display">Display heading</h2>

- `.heading-1`
- `.heading-2`
- `.heading-3`
- `.heading-4`
- `.heading-5`
- `.heading-6`
