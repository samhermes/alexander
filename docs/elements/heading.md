Headings take advantage of two different type scales, one for narrow screens, and one for wide screens. This ensures that headings are not too overwhelmingly large on a mobile device, but clear and easy to read on a desktop or laptop.

<div class="stage">
    <h1>Heading level 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading level 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading level 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading level 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading level 6</h6>
</div>

## Heading classes

Often, the visual design is at odds with the structural hierarchy of a page, so Alexander includes a set of heading classes. They can be applied to any heading to make it look like any other heading level. This is useful for areas of a page where the heading level may structurally be an h2, such as in a footer or sidebar, but look best with smaller font sizes.

- `.heading-1`
- `.heading-2`
- `.heading-3`
- `.heading-4`
- `.heading-5`
- `.heading-6`
