First, of note, the component-level styles include cross-browser fixes, and other general improvements to the rendering of form elements. As these should only be included in a project only if forms are in use, they are not included in the base level styles.

<form class="form">
    <label>
        Input label
        <input type="text">
    </label>
<form>
